# ezfuck

ezfuck is a BrainFuck derivative. It uses the same commands but adds many features to make the language more "usable".

## Commands

 - Math operators:
  - `+ - * \`

 - Move the cell pointer left and right:
  - `< >`

 - Move instruction pointer left/right:
  - `{ }`

 - Start/stop loop:
  - `[ ]`

 - Number literals:
  - `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`

 - Set the current cell 's value:
  - `^`

 - Get the current cell's value:
  - `V`

## Features

 - Cells can hold any positive value up to Java's `Long/MAX_VALUE`

 - Cells expand to the right as needed. Cells with a value of 0 are also automatically removed from the right.

 - Cells don't "wrap" from left to right. Going left past the first cell is a no-op.

 - Commands (with the exception of `[ ]` and `V`) can take a number as an argument.
  - `>5` is the same as `>>>>>`, while `+++++++++++++++++` can be written as `+17`

 - The "insertion"/"extraction" operators (`V`/`^`) can be used to directly set a cells value, and get the cell's value to be used as an argument for another command.
  - `^5` sets the current cell's value to 5, regardless of what it was before
  - `V` evaluates to the current cells value, immediately before the command on its right is run.
  - `^20 >V` sets the current cell to `20`, then takes that value and gives it to `>`. This would be the same as `>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>`. You could also do something like `,>V`, which would move to the right based on user input.

 - The instruction pointer can be manipulated directly using `{` and `}`. Like `]`, the jump will only happen if the current cell has a value of 0. `+{` will produce an infinite loop.

- - - - -

BrainFuck code is valid ezfuck code, providing:

 - The code doesn't contain comments with any of the new symbols. Having a number, `{`, `}`, `^` or `V` in the comments could potentially change the behavior of the code.

 - The code doesn't rely on BrainFuck's cell value wrapping from 0-255, or the cell pointer wrapping from left to right.


## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

With the `jar` in the current directory, run:

    $ java -jar ezfuck-1-standalone.jar

 to start a REPL.

 The REPL can also be started directly by running `ezfuck.interpreter/repl`

## Options

So far it's only a REPL. Will add interpreter options shortly.

### Bugs

None yet!

## Examples

 - To multiply in BrainFuck, you can do something like `++++[>+++<-]` to multiply `4` and `3`. In ezfuck, this could be written as `+4[>+3-]`, or just `+3*4`. The last example doesn't require a second cell, since the loop is no longer required.
 - Operators can be "chained" to carry out longer equations:
  - `+5*6/10`, `,+48`
